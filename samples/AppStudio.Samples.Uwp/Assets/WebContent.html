    On <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/07/13/windows-10-launch-celebrating-with-our-fans-and-announcing-upgradeyourworld/">July 13</a>, we outlined how we would approach our launch to Windows 10. Since then we‘ve heard an overwhelming response from the Windows community around the world. We’re at 75 million users and running in 192 countries, going strong.
</p>
<p>
    We’re also making fast progress on our broader goal of celebrating people and organizations who do great things. It has been truly exciting to see how our employees and countless other people around the world have taken action over the last month to #UpgradeYourWorld. Whether they’re <a href="https://instagram.com/p/5u0yImotvQ/">sharing</a> a meal with someone less fortunate,<a href="https://twitter.com/robertbuckley/status/626473158665732097"> donating</a> items to those in need or <a href="https://sway.com/aKka4TnFc4bZmggJ">visiting</a> a secondary school in Kenya, people all over the world have embraced the movement and joined in to make a difference – whether big or small.
</p>
<p>
    Today marks another milestone in our yearlong <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/upgradeyourworld/nonprofit-resources.html">Upgrade Your World</a> initiative. After tallying fan votes and the outpouring of responses on social media, the <a href="http://www.beaglefreedomproject.org/">Beagle Freedom Project</a> has emerged as the winner of the tenth global nonprofit partnership. Their mission is to save the lives of laboratory animals and change the lives of people through these rescue operations. They will receive a $500,000 monetary donation and be upgraded with Microsoft technology and services to help aid the future success of the organization.

    September also marks the beginning of our first global partnership of the Upgrade Your World initiative with <a href="http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6146369/k.95B8/Ways_To_Give.htm?msource=wexgpwtgb814&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwx_WuBRDJ7tSK2-W0pJkBEiQAEWgR8Lya2M0s42DaROnPplxsaWGjCehp69sYxlf2W31gvRoaAqYW8P8HAQ">Save the Children</a>. We were fortunate enough to see the real impact this organization first-hand at a preschool in a remote community in Vietnam, which can be seen in this video below.

    Throughout the month, we will be working with Save the Children to provide them with a software upgrade, so they can do more good and create more impact around the world.

<p>
